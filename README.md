# Software Development Plan.
## Purpose & Scope.
### Purpose :
Swap4U is a small program that creates questionnaires where the admin can create questions as needed. It is suitable for use in creating a variety of questionnaires because the program itself can generate questions and answers independently. The program has the ability to create questionnaires in the form of Open Ended Question and Close Ended Question or other forms of questionnaires depending on the application of this user.

### Problem :
In the past, questionnaires were available in paper form distributed at various locations to ask the opinions of the target groups. The people who distribute the questionnaire will be distributed in the place that is the gathering place of that target audience. Nowadays, creating the same questionnaire is a huge waste and time-consuming process. Because due to many factors example, the current behaviour has changed and people are paying attention to communication devices or social media. Therefore, Swap4U has a direct solution to this problem because it is a small program and is also easy to use. Because no matter how many eras have passed, information from that target audience is essential to many companies and businesses. Because the information is very valuable in today's times, for example doing business or advertising, if the lack of target audience data, there is a very useless opportunity to invest.
### Target Audience :
Swap4U is a program suitable for target audiences working with trading or advertising agencies that require target audience data to be used in various applications, as this program can generate questionnaires. It can be easily applied in a variety of formats. That is, the main target audience for this program, as for the secondary audience, it is the general user. Because the program itself can do many different types of questionnaires. Users who want to use it to easily create small and large scale questionnaires. It does not have to be a user who works on commercial tasks.
### Target Audience Usage :
Swap4U usage patterns are run through Bash and are listed in the detailed installation at the end of this document.

# Features
### User System :
The user system of the Swap4U program is divided into two parts. The first part is the admin that will be able to control different parts of the system in the program. There will be no admin sign-up, the admin's ID and password are already set on the system. Unlike general users who have an signup system to be able to login to the system, do a query and send it directly to the system with the username. The admin will be able to create questionnaires and can check the questionnaires later. That is the main function of the admin user.

### Quiz & Answer Storage :
In the program, there is a system to collect information between the questionnaire and the answers from the general user who came to the questionnaire. The query that is generated by the admin is always kept the same as the user's answer. Both parts of the file are stored as a CSV file for other purposes, depending on how the user is used. The administrator can use the backup command to another file name and it will be placed in the backup folder. On the other hand, files can be deleted from the system in case they are not needed. 

    Suggestions should be backed up every time, in case you want to bring questions and answers back to use next time.

### Selection User Interface :
